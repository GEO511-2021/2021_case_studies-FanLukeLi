# Introduction to problem/question
  
# Problem / Question
There are many shooting incidents in New York city each year. Are the occurrences of these shooting incidents 
random or are they spatially dependent? This project uses spatial autocorrelation to test spatial heterogeneity
in New York city shooting incident each year from 2006 to 2021. Then, this project uses cluster 
detection algorithms to capture these spatial clusters and finally map them according to layers grouped by year. 

# Inspiring Examples

## Example 1
[Space-Time Clustering of Crime Events and Neighborhood Characteristics in Houston](https://heinonline-org.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/HOL/Page?lname=&public=false&collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/crmrev40&men_hide=false&men_tab=toc&kind=&page=340)
This example is a spatial-temporal interaction analysis of Houston burglary and shooting crimes. The analysis of this study covers 12 super neighborhoods in Houston's southwest quadrant with Knox method for space-time interaction. Unique clustering signatures of each type of crime event is suggested in the findings.

This example is clear in the research question and has detailed background research about spatial-temporal interactions of crime. Therefore, this study could be referenced to suggest what variables and statistics to look at in this project.
